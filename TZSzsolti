One day he goes to a party. 
It is a birthday party for his friend Gergo. 
He enjoys the party with his friends. 
They dance and have fun.
At the end of night, Gergo's mother comes with a cake. 
Everyone is very happy. 
They like sweet cakes. 
Zsolti is also happy. 
Mother slices the cake and gives every kid a piece of cake. 
Zsolti is the first one that gets a piece. 
At first, he is very happy, but after a few moments he turns blue. 
He runs outside.
When he returns, everybody is very surprised. 
His friend Gergo asks,
Zsolti, is everything alright? 
You don't behave like yourself!
Zsolti is surprised. Why, Gergo? 
Why do you say that?
Well, Gergo answers, you usually love food very much! 
You don't run away from food!
Zsolti smiles and says, Yes, Gergo, I love food. But that cake is not food!
